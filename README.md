## Tech Stack and Used Package

- Frontend:
    - React (UI)
    - Redux (State Management)
    - React Icons
    - React Modal
    - React Toastify
    - Axios (HTTP Request Agent)
    - TailwindCSS (UI Styling)
    - Vite (Module Bundler)

- Backend:
    - Express (Server)
    - Body Parser (HTTP data parser)
    - CORS
    - Sequelize (ORM Database)
    - Mysql2 (Database connector)

## System Limitation

- Layout responsiveness is not guaranteed.
- Very simple UI design.
- Fetching invoice data is implemented, but not sure whether it uses lazy loading technique or not.
- Not all the requirements can be implemented due to lack of knowledge and experience on how to implement these
  requirements.

## Installation Instruction

Open terminal and type this command

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/AlfitoDimasss/react-invoice-system
$ cd react-invoice-system
$ npm install
$ cd Frontend
$ npm install
$ cd ..
```

Change some database credential in folder `./backend/config/config.js`. You need to override the `data` variable using
your MySQL/MariaDB credential.

After database credential have been set, make sure you create database in your machine using `data.dbName` variable that
you have set before using this query.

```
CREATE DATABASE your-data.dbName;
```

After it successfully, then open di project directory again and open terminal, then make sure you're in the root of the
project directory, and run this command.

```
$ npm run serve
```

After server already running, open new tab terminal and type this command

```
$ cd frontend
$ npm run dev
```

And then open the local server on your browser to use the System.
